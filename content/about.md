### Background
I am Casual Engineer, daily life managing engineering people [@kioser](https://kioser.com), teacher and speaker sometimes.
I have been doing programming for about 5 years and still counting.

I am using PHP, Golang for programming and now more interested in system architecture and system reliability.

Currently, i am writing this blog to share my thought.

### Litte More

I am in love in technology since the college from programming, product management, and everything corelated in this area. And from that background, i have worked for several companies in my hometown.

I also in love in books,literacy, and the communities inside it. So i created [@titikmula](https://www.instagram.com/titikmula/) - a library, public spaces, and creativity hub in my [hometown](http://www.pangkepkab.go.id/).

In my free time, i love reading books (currently love reading fiction books), running, basketball, and have a talk with my friends. and also writing everything i think i should write about.

So.. yeah.. that's my introduction.
