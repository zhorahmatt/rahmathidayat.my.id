<!-- # Hi there -->

My name is **Rahmat** ("Azho/Aso", "Zho", "Rahmat", or "Dayat" or whatever you like to call me)
and I'm currently writing all things in this blog.

I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

I made this blog personally as my therapy of having overthinking. a friend once told me, why dont you try to write what you thinking into some personal writing. So finally i am writing on this blog (before that, i have sort of personal notebook containing a complicated story).

So if you enjoy my story and can related to you, i hope it will help, let's be friend of sharing same things. Will be much interesting if we have common problem and solving this (or maybe just feeling together :D).

You can contact me on email : info.rahmathidayat@gmail.com

So, there you have it... enjoy!
