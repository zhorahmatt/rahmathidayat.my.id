It's here! My New Blog

After long time with the old style and not updating any story in this blog, this blog finally arise to the public. :D

#### Stack
I am using hugo as static site generator([SSR](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/)). I love how easy using this tools with less effort of learning new things. just using some template available, publish, and it done. Your blog/web is ON.

**Why Not Using Wordpress?**
Personally,I don't have much experience on it and i don't want any server side processing on my blog, just simply write md/html file and boom! it publish to the public.


#### Hosting
I am building and hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I really impressed how quick it deploy and integrate with github with auto-deploy

#### Problems???
So far, i don't find any trouble when building and hosting this blog, i don't know if later my posts contains lots of images and functions, it will crash sometimes, but let's try...

**Overall** I am **Happy** with the stack and will continue improving this blog for better experience.
